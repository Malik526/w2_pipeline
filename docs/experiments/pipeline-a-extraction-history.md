# Pipeline A Extraction History

This file records benchmark interpretation notes that affect how Pipeline A
results should be compared over time.

## Phase 4 Native-PDF Smoke Baseline

The initial Phase 4 Pipeline A implementation established the deterministic
native-text/OCR baseline and verified internal generated clean PDFs:

```text
date: 2026-09-03
scope: internal generated W-2 clean PDFs, first 5 documents
route: native_pdf
field_accuracy: 1.0
failure_rate: 0.0
```

This run validated the canonical extraction/evaluation plumbing for local
fixtures. It was not an external OCR realism benchmark.

## Phase 4B External OCR Baseline

Phase 4B installed and exercised Tesseract OCR end to end against prepared
Symage synthetic 2026 W-2 image renders:

```text
date: 2026-09-04
scope: external Symage clean renders, 150 documents
artifact: data/evaluation/results/phase4b_external_clean_150.json
field_accuracy: 0.9887878787878788
failure_rate: 0.0
average_duration_seconds: 2.2230018675666874
```

The companion robustness run covered all prepared clean, compressed, rotated,
and blurred variants:

```text
artifact: data/evaluation/results/phase4b_external_all_variants_600.json
documents: 600
field_accuracy: 0.8926515151515152
failure_rate: 0.0
average_duration_seconds: 2.1310415448267
```

These artifacts are useful historical OCR baselines. They predate the Box e
employee-name semantic correction below.

## Post-Phase 4B Box e Name Correction

The official 2026 Form W-2 Box e separates employee name into:

```text
Employee's first name and initial | Last name | Suff.
```

The canonical schema already represented this as `employee.first_name`,
`employee.middle_initial`, `employee.last_name`, and `employee.suffix`.
However, the Symage adapter previously stored first name plus middle initial
inside `employee.first_name`, and the OCR layout fallback could read a
slightly higher middle-initial token before the first-name token.

The correction:

- splits Symage `Employee's first name and initial` answers into first name and
  nullable middle initial
- includes `employee.middle_initial` in external `evaluated_field_paths`
- orders OCR Box e name-zone words left-to-right
- filters tiny OCR fragments in employee-name zones when normal-size neighbor
  tokens are present
- preserves exact string comparison, including accents
- adds run metadata to saved Pipeline A benchmark summaries

Historical Phase 4B result artifacts should not be used for corrected Box e
name-accuracy claims. Reruns after this correction must regenerate local
external ground truth from annotations before executing Pipeline A.
